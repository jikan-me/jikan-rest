Jikan is a REST API for [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net). It scrapes the website to satisfy the need for API functionality that MyAnimeList.net lacks.

The raison d'être of Jikan is to assist developers easily get the data they need for their apps and projects without having to depend on unstable APIs, or sidetracking their projects to develop parsers.

The word _Jikan_ literally translates to _Time_ in Japanese (**時間**). And that's what this API saves you of. ;)

**Notice**: Jikan REST API does not support authenticated requests. You can not update your lists. Use the official MyAnimeList API for this!
