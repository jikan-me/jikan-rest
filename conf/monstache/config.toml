# connection settings

# connect to MongoDB using the following URL
mongo-url = "mongodb://someuser:password@localhost:40001"
# connect to the Elasticsearch REST API at the following node URLs
elasticsearch-urls = ["https://es1:9200", "https://es2:9200"]

# frequently required settings

# if you need to seed an index from a collection and not just listen and sync changes events
# you can copy entire collections or views from MongoDB to Elasticsearch
direct-read-namespaces = ["jikan.anime", "jikan.manga", "jikan.people", "jikan.characters", "jikan.users"]

# if you want to use MongoDB change streams instead of legacy oplog tailing use change-stream-namespaces
# change streams require at least MongoDB API 3.6+
# if you have MongoDB 4+ you can listen for changes to an entire database or entire deployment
# in this case you usually don't need regexes in your config to filter collections unless you target the deployment.
# to listen to an entire db use only the database name.  For a deployment use an empty string.
change-stream-namespaces = ["jikan.anime", "jikan.manga", "jikan.people", "jikan.characters", "jikan.users"]

# additional settings

# if you don't want to listen for changes to all collections in MongoDB but only a few
# e.g. only listen for inserts, updates, deletes, and drops from mydb.mycollection
# this setting does not initiate a copy, it is only a filter on the change event listener

# do not start processing at the beginning of the MongoDB oplog
# if you set the replay to true you may see version conflict messages
# in the log if you had synced previously. This just means that you are replaying old docs which are already
